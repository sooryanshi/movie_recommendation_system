# Movies Recommender System
## About Dataset
### Context
 These files contain metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of
 movies released on or before July 2017. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters,
 release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages.
 This dataset also has files containing 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. Ratings are on a
 scale of 1-5 and have been obtained from the official GroupLens website.
## Acknowledgements
 This dataset is an ensemble of data collected from TMDB and GroupLens.
 The Movie Details, Credits and Keywords have been collected from the TMDB Open API. This product uses the
 TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.

## Conclusion

This project has been an incredible learning journey into the world of machine learning. Throughout the development of this movie recommender system, I have gained hands-on experience with key concepts such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and collaborative filtering. Implementing algorithms like Matrix Factorization (SVD) has deepened my understanding of how machine learning models can be used to derive meaningful insights from data. Additionally, building and deploying this system has provided valuable insights into the practical challenges of working with real-world data and deploying models in a web application. Overall, this project has not only enhanced my technical skills but also ignited a passion for exploring more advanced machine learning techniques. I look forward to applying these skills to future projects and continuing to grow as a machine learning practitioner.
